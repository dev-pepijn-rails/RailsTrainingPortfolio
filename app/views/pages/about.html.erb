  <h1 class="cover-heading">About me</h1>
  <p class="lead">
  	 For a long time, I've been working in IT projects, fulfilling all kind of roles.
  	 Outside working hours I've worked on non profit voluntary projects regularly, to contribute to a more beautiful world.
  	 However, this has not always been very effective. And as a result of that was sometimes even quite frustrating!
  	 Due to the Corono crisis I have decided to dedicate a part of my workweek to a non profit project.
  	 In this project I'm going to create a platform that joins people and projects that contribute to a more beautiful world. 
  	 The platform will help creating a network, a community of people working on all kinds op initiatives and projects, helping each other.
